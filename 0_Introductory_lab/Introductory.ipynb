The real reason is because Python and JavaScript excel at two very distinct tasks. **_Python_ is a high-level language with many great libraries with built-in image processing algorithms, and it is great for visualizing results. On the other hand, _JavaScript_ is a fairly low-level programming language, and it is great for implementing image processing algorithms by accessing each pixel in an image.** \n",

    " 1. for you to understand how Image Processing methods work in detail, pixel by pixel, for which we will mostly use JavaScript, and\n",

    "Declaring a variable in python is very simple. We have three basic types of variables:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Numbers\n",
    "my_var = 2\n",
    "my_var = 5.2\n",
    "# Strings\n",
    "my_var = 'Either use single quotes'\n",

    "# Boolean\n",
    "my_var = True\n",
    "my_var = False\n",
    "```\n",
    "Every variable can hold every type of data, so we don't need to specify the type at initialization.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can have lists of several items:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# List of numbers\n",
    "my_list = [2.5, 7, 3.3]\n",
    "# List of strings\n",
    "my_list = ['E.T.', 'phone', 'home']\n",
    "# List of booleans\n",
    "my_list = [True, True, False]\n",
    "```\n",
    "Lists are 0-indexed and can be accessed with square brackets:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Set the 3rd element of my_list to 5\n",
    "my_list[2] = 5\n",
    "# Retrieve the 2nd element of my_list\n",
    "new_var = my_list[1]\n",
    "```\n",
    "Similarly we can make tuples, which are just like lists, but their values cannot be modified after they have been initialized:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# This is a tuple of three numbers\n",
    "my_tuple = (3, 8.6, 4)\n",
    "# Access to a tuple is similar to lists\n",
    "new_var = my_tuple[1]\n",
    "# But we cannot write to a tuple!\n",

    ">> 1\n",
    "# Power\n",
    "a ** b\n",
    ">> 25\n",
    "```\n",
    "We can have conditional statements\n",

To make things easier, we created our own JavaScript class, `image-access`, which facilitates the handling of images in JavaScript. Feel free to check out the documentation [here](https://github.com/Biomedical-Imaging-Group/image-access/wiki). Every `image-access` object is a container for an image and provides easy-to-use methods for pixel access that take care of boundary conditions.

    "var img = new Image(an_existing_image.shape());\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* By default, the image is initialized to $0$ for every pixel, but we can choose an alternative initialization value. For this, we need to create an `options` object in which we specify the `init_value` attribute and then we pass this object to the `Image` constructor\n",

Ideally, the variable should be self-explanatory and end with the word *viewer* to avoid confusion (for example, `first_viewer` as above). Some of the most importante features of a `viewer` are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Images**: The same viewer can load many images at once. In this example, it was created with $4$ images. By default, you can switch between the images using the buttons `Prev` and `Next` on the widgets panel.\n",
    "* **Titles**: You can give the viewer titles for each image, which will be shown immediately above it. If you do not provide a title for some images, the variable name will be shown by default. In this example, only $2$ were given.\n",
    "* **Customization**: Several of the class' functionalities (e.g., `widgets`, `hist`, `axis`, `colorbar`) can be enabled from the beginning. A user can later turn them off using the widgets or [calling methods](#prog_customization) of the object. \n",
    "* **Colormap**: The colormap to be used can be set from the start with the parameter `cmap = colormap`, where `colormap` is a string that specifies the desired colormap. It can be dynamically changed using `Options` and choosing one of the supported colormaps in the drop-down menu. \n",
    "* **Statistics**: On the lower part of the widget panel, the image statistics of the area of the image being displayed are shown. If you use the button with a little square at the left of the images to zoom into a selected region, you will see the statistics are updated in real time. You can also use the button with crossed double-arrows to pan through the image at a specific level of zoom. You can always use the button *Reset* to see the whole image again.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-warning\">\n",
    "    \n",
    "<b>Beware: </b> The statistics displayed in the `imviewer` objects are rounded to the second decimal. If you need an exact statistic, use the functions <a href = 'https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.mean.html'><code>np.mean</code></a> or <a href = 'https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.std.html'><code>np.std</code></a> on the images (NumPy arrays) directly.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Histogram**: Besides the normal *counts* vs *value* bars in a histogram, you will see a black line. This line represents *input* vs *output* intensity values. This line changes its position and slope if you change the brightness and contrast of the image. All pixel values that are to the left of the point where the line touches the bottom have the minimum intensity, and all that are to the right of the point where the line touches the top have the maximum intensity, and the ones that are in-between those two points have an intensity that is linearly scaled between the maximum and minumum value.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Display mode**: There are several options to display a list of images\n",
    "    * Default display: Display only one image at a time, and use the buttons `Next` and `Prev` to browse the different images. \n",
    "    * Set `subplots=(m, n)`: Arrange the images in an $m \\times n$ grid."

Therefore, after you fully understand the nature of every algorithm, and have implemented them yourself in JavaScript, the labs will always move towards trustworthy implementations in popular image processing libraries. There are many libraries available, but throughout this course we will focus on three of the most common:\n",

    "* [**`openCV`**](https://opencv.org/about/): It stands for Open Computer Vision. As the name suggests, it provides thousands of open source algorithms for computer vision applications. The fact that it supports several programming laguages (`C++`, `Python`, `Java` and `Matlab`), and that it has over 20 years of history explains the huge community of users. Thus, there is also extensive documentation and tutorials, not only in its official website, but also on several other sites.  \n",
    "* [**`scipy.ndimage`**](https://www.scipy.org/) SciPy stands stands for Scientific Python, and it is one of the most widely used Python libraries (in fact `NumPy` and `Matplotlib`, considered standards in Python, are two of their packages). As OpenCV, it is open-source and it has a huge community, as well as extensive documentation and tutorials. It has a myriad of applications for scientific and technical computing. In the IP courses we will focus on their module built for [Multi-dimensional image processing (`ndimage`)](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/ndimage.html).\n",
    "* [**`scikit-image`**](https://scikit-image.org/) Scikit stands for SciPy Toolkits. These toolkits are add-on packages for SciPy. They are developed and maintained individually. As SciPy, they are open-source projects. Some of these Scikits have become very well known, and have a large community of users and developers. Scikit-Image is one of them, developed specifically for image-processing tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "While there are other good libraries for image processing, we will focus on these three because their history and community ensure long-term support and extensive documentation and examples. Whenever we want you to use one of these libraries, we will either use a function to exemplify an operation, or we will include a link to the documentation of that particular function.\n",
